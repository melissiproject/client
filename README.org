* Melissi Cloud Storage Desktop Client
** About
   Melissi cloud storage desktop client is a client for [[http://github.com/melissiproject/server][melissi cloud
   storage server]]. The client will keep the special /melissi/
   directory in your home folder in sync with the server, by
   automatically downloading new files and updates of existing files
   and also posting locally created files.

  client and use it with a melissi server (aka /hive/).

  For installation on how to install the desktop client please visit
  [[http://melissi-client.readthedocs.org][our docs at readthedocs.org]].
